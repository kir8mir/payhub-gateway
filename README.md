# payhub-gateway

A small backend service exploring reliable payment-provider callback handling with
multi-tenant isolation — the part of fintech/iGaming payment infrastructure that
sits between "PSP/GSP sends us a webhook" and "we can trust and process it safely."

PSP and GSP are fully mocked (no
real external providers, no balance/ledger logic) — the focus is on the plumbing
around them: identity, callback ingestion, idempotency, and tenant isolation.

## Stack

- Node.js 22, NestJS + TypeScript
- Prisma 7 (`@prisma/adapter-pg`) + PostgreSQL
- Docker / docker-compose

## What's implemented

- **identity** — register / login (JWT) / `GET /profile/me`, email scoped per
  brand (`@@unique([email, brandId])`), not globally.
- **callbacks** — `POST /webhooks/psp/:provider` and `POST /webhooks/gsp/:provider`,
  protected by an HMAC-SHA256 signature guard, routed through a Strategy + Factory
  pair (`CallbackHandlerFactory` → `PspCallbackHandler` / `GspCallbackHandler`) so
  the adapters can only ever persist a raw event — never touch a balance.
  Idempotent by construction: a DB-level unique constraint
  (`@@unique([brandId, key])`) is the actual source of truth, not just an
  in-code check, so concurrent duplicate callbacks can't race past it.
- **tenant isolation** — every query is explicitly scoped by `brandId`, sourced
  from the JWT for identity routes and from the `x-brand-id` header for webhooks.
- **observability** — every request gets a correlation id (`x-correlation-id`,
  generated if the caller didn't send one), guaranteed on every response
  including errors; every request is logged with method/path/status/duration.
- **structured errors** — a global exception filter returns
  `{ statusCode, error, message, correlationId }` for every failure.

See [API.md](API.md) for request examples and [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) for
the reasoning behind these choices and the trade-offs that come with them.

## Prerequisites

- Docker + Docker Compose

Nothing else — Node/npm/Prisma are only used inside the containers.

## Run it

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env if you want different secrets/ports, defaults work as-is

docker compose up --build
```

This builds the app image, starts PostgreSQL, waits for it to be healthy, then
starts the API. On every boot the app runs `prisma db push` against the DB
(see [DECISIONS.md](DECISIONS.md) for why this project uses `db push` instead of
migration files), so the schema is always in sync — no separate migrate step.

- API: http://localhost:3000
- Health check: `GET /health`
- PostgreSQL is also reachable on the host at `localhost:15432` (mapped from the
  container's internal `5432`, in case you already have a local Postgres on the
  default port)

## Running the tests

Tests run against the `build` stage of the image (it has the dev dependencies
the `runtime` stage intentionally doesn't ship with):

```bash
docker build --target build -t payhub-test .
```

**Unit tests** (no DB required):

```bash
docker run --rm payhub-test npm test
```

**E2E tests** (need a running Postgres — start it first, and use the in-network
hostname `payhub-db` for `DATABASE_URL`):

```bash
docker compose up -d payhub-db
docker run --rm --env-file .env --network payhub-gateway_default \
  -e DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<user>:<pass>@payhub-db:5432/<db> \
  payhub-test npm run test:e2e
```

(substitute `<user>`/`<pass>`/`<db>` with the `POSTGRES_PAYHUB_*` values from
your `.env`). E2E tests generate their own random `brandId`/email/webhookId
per run, so they don't need any seed data and are safe to re-run against a
persistent dev database.
